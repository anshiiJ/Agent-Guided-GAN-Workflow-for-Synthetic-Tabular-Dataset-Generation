            "\n",
            "Starting with demographics: the prompt lists age, gender, and location. Age is clearly a numerical value, so it should be an integer. Gender is a category, so that's a string with possible values like 'Male' or 'Female'. Location could be a string as well, representing cities or regions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, subscription details include plan_type, monthly_charges, and total_charges. Plan_type is definitely a categorical variable, maybe something like 'Basic' or 'Premium'. Monthly_charges and total_charges are monetary values, so they should be floats to allow for decimal points.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moving on to usage behavior: data_usage is in GB, which is a numerical value, so that's an integer. Call_minutes is also a numerical value, so another integer. Service_calls are the number of times a customer contacted support, so that's an integer too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, customer history has tenure, payment_method, and paperless_billing. Tenure is how long the customer has been with the service, so that's an integer in months. Payment_method could be categories like 'Credit Card' or 'Bank Transfer'. Paperless_billing is a yes/no option, so that's a boolean.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should also think about constraints. Age can't be negative and probably has an upper limit, say 120. Monthly and total charges are positive and likely under certain maximum amounts. Data_usage and call_minutes should also be non-negative.\n",

If they are the same, then the number is an integer (e.g. 23.0 or 45.0); otherwise the age was a floating-point number and we discard it (e.g. 15.5 is different from 15). [...] The next step is to remove floating-point ages (lines 21 and 22). Generally, ages are recorded as integer values, so we\\u2019ll simply remove those floating-point values. Keep in mind removing data should always be done with careful consideration. In these articles we are taking the easy way out for the sake of simplicity, but on a real project there are other options such as rounding up/down, replacing by the average value, etc. [...] With a second plot (line 18), we can see the distribution of ages is now more uniform.\\n\\nTitle: Sampling a specific age distribution from a dataset - Stack Overflow\\nContent: Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.\\n\\nSampling a specific age distribution from a dataset\\n\\nSuppose I have a dataset with 1,000,000 observations.

[...] Age heaping is the tendency to report children\\u2019s ages to the nearest\\nyear or adult ages to the nearest multiple of 5 or 10 years. Age heaping\\nis very common. It is a major reason why data from nutritional\\nanthropometry surveys are often analysed and reported using broad\\nage-groups. The commonest age-groups used with children\\u2019s data are 6 to\\n17 months, 18 to 29 months, 30 to 41 months, 42 to 53 months, and 54 to\\n59 months (see figure below). These are known as year-centred [...] The age-groups are expressed using the form specified in ISO 31-11,\\nan international standard that applies to mathematical symbols. The form\\n[a,b) expresses the interval \\\\(a \\u2264 x <\\nb\\\\). For example, [30,35) is used to indicate the set {30, 31,\\n32, 33, 34} of ages in years. The form [a,b) is said to be\\nclosed on the left and open on the right.\\n\\nThe reference data (ref) uses five-year age-groups. We\\nwill create the same age-groups in the example dataset.\\n\\nTitle: Age Structure - Our World in Data\\nContent: We can also see this distribution of young and old populations across the world clearly in the two maps below. These again show the age dependency ratio, but are now split between young (under 15 years) and old (65+ years) dependency ratios. [...] The median age provides an important single indicator of the age distribution of a population. It provides the age 'midpoint' of a population \\u2014 where there are the same number of people who are older than the median age as there are younger than it.\\n\\nOn the map, we see the median age in all countries in the world.\\n\\nOverall we see that higher-income countries across North America, Europe, and East Asia tend to have a higher median age. [...] In this chart, you can explore the projected age structure of future populations for any country or world region, by clicking on the \\u201cChange country\\u201d button.\\n\\nAs we discuss in our exploration of dependency ratios, this distribution between working age versus young and old (dependent) populations is important for the economic and social functioning of societies.\\n\" } ]\n",

So, the data isn't going to be uniformly distributed. Most people won't live beyond 100, so the max can probably be tightened to 100. The distribution might be skewed to the left since there are more younger people, especially in developing countries. The median age globally is around 30, so that's a point of reference.\n",

            "\"Location\" is another string attribute with options for City, Suburban, or Rural.

But I'm not entirely sure without more specific data.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Plan_type\" has three options: Basic, Premium, Pro. Without specific data, it's hard to assign exact probabilities, but I think Basic would be the most common, followed by Premium, then Pro.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Monthly_charges\" is a float between 0 and 1000. I'm assuming it's right-skewed since people might pay more for premium services, but it could vary. Maybe the mean is around $80 with a standard deviation of $30, but this is a guess.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Attributes and Types**: Each attribute is defined with its type (`integer`, `number`, `string`, or `boolean`) and constraints (min, max, enum, etc.).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Distributions**: For each attribute, a distribution is specified to guide synthetic data generation:\n",
            "   - `right-skewed`: Indicates data that skews to the right (e.g., age, tenure).\n",
            "   - `uniform`: Data is evenly distributed across possible values (e.g., gender).\n",
            "   - `skewed`: Data is unevenly distributed (e.g., location, plan_type).\n",
            "   - `poisson`: Used for count data (e.g., service_calls).\n",
            "   - `bernoulli`: Used for binary outcomes (e.g., paperless_billing).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Parameters for Distributions**: Additional parameters like `mean`, `median`, `standard_deviation`, and `probability` are included to fine-tune the data generation process.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Defaults**: Default values are provided for optional fields to ensure synthetic data generation can proceed even if some fields are not explicitly specified.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Rules**: Additional constraints are specified to enforce logical relationships between attributes (e.g., total_charges must be greater than or equal to monthly_charges).\n",
            "\n",
            "This schema can be used with synthetic data generation tools or libraries (e.g., `faker`, `mimesis`, or custom scripts) to produce realistic and consistent synthetic data that matches the specified distributions and constraints.\n",
